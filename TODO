1.  Account for all kinds of WakeLocks (Screen, Full, Partial) - and create a more
    fine grained domain, following the scheme in Pathak pg.4.

2.  Unresolved Callbacks can have wakelock info too: propagate thread info for
    them as well?

3.  Get rid of JNI methods from CG construction.

Like WakeLocks we can have "exotic" components, e.g. camera on/off.
